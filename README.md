# Data-scientist-LATAM-challenge

This repository stands for the data scientists challenge sent by LATAM Airlines to join their Data scientist team. 
The code was developed with **Python3** as primary programming language, using a **Jupyter notebook** to test the solution and show the process followed. 
Under the charts folders, you can find all the plots generated that helped me to answer the questions. 
Under the datasets folder, you can find all the datasets generated with the data cleaning and synthetic features.
