# Flight delay prediction

This repository stands a DS solution to predict whether a flight will be dalyed or not based on a dataset of flights from Chile. 
The code was developed with **Python3** as primary programming language, using a **Jupyter notebook** to test the solution and show the process followed. 

Under the charts and delayed_flights folders, you can find all the plots generated that helped me to answer the questions. 
Under the datasets folder, you can find all the datasets generated with the data cleaning and synthetic features.
